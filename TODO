	* The current support of Cray Data Virtualization Service
	needs to be expanded. We currently assumes a path served by
	a dvs is globally unique and thus use a URI format of
	dvs://local_path. Two issues: 
        1) even if the assumption is true, this string is not globally 
        unique when our module is used in a tool that has a component 
        running on a log-in node. The component on the log-in node will 
        get a fully qualified URI like nfs://abc.edf.gov/exported_path.
	2) the assumption can be broken. E.g., There could be more than
	one shared root node is involved for an allocation. (Though I
        have not seen the evidence of this.)

	A solution I am thinking of is to put a logic that can do
	double lookup to peal the virtualization done by DVS. E.g., 
	to build a mount point map, the module can copy over 
        the /proc/mounts file from a corresponding DVS server and 
        use to peel the virtualization. The DVS server infomation
	is available as part of mount point option.

	So far, I confirmed that ssh can be done to a SIO node from
        a CN with some authentication settings.  But I still have 
	to understand that what it means to have multiple DVS servers
	serving dvs mount for failover-failback; parallel striping
	and etc. My current thought is that it would suffice to 
	copy the mounts file from the first DVS server because
	each file is likely served by a unique underlying file system
	like PanFS, NFS or parallel file systems. (though they
	are served through multiple DVS servers for various reasons.)
	Hopefully, Cray does not have a configuration where they
	have more than one shared root servers. 
	
	All to-be-investigated items.
