##  Update Log:
##        Apr 26 2013 DHA: Added test cases
##        May 23 2011 DHA: File created.
##

1. Configuration 

    % mkdir <platform> (e.g., RHEL6_x86_64_ib)
    % cd <platform>
    % ../configure --prefix=<your install path>

    
    For Blue Gene /P Compute Node: 
    % configure CXX=bgxlC --prefix=<your install path>
    Note that you should not use bgxlC when this module
    is run on the I/O Nodes of Blue Gene


    For Blue Gene /L Compute Node:
    % configure CXX=bgxlC LDFLAGS="-lnss_files -lnss_dns -lresolv -lc -lnss_files -lnss_dns -lresolv" --prefix=<your install path>


    For Cray XT/XE Compute Node
    % module load gcc/4.4.2 #or whatever the right gcc version for CN
    % configure CXX=CC --prefix=<your install path> --disable-shared
   

2. Build and Installation

    % make
    % make install


3. Testing

    % cd share/MountPointAttr/tests

    Test cases are installed into this directory. If you want to 
    increase the verbosity level, use the MPA_TEST_ENABLE_VERBOSE
    environment variable. E.g., 

    % setenv MPA_TEST_ENABLE_VERBOSE 1 

    The current test cases:
    * test001_recursive_walk_remote: 
        takes an absolute path and tests if it is serviced by a remote 
        file server. If the path is a directory, this test checks all 
        files in it and its subdirectories by recursively walking the 
        directories. It prints out "PASS", when all files are evaluated
        to be "remote."

    * test002_recursive_walk_local: 
        takes an absolute path and tests if it is serviced by a local 
        file system. Otherwise, the behavior is the same as 
        test001_recursive_walk_remote.

    * test003_corner_path:
        takes no arguments. It tests if MPA can handle ill-formed paths: 
        relative paths and invalid paths. At the end of the test, it tests 
        if MPA returns error codes on the home directory (using $HOME) 
        that should not be invalid. It prints out "PASS," when succeeds.

    * test004_hardlink_path:
        takes no arguments. It tests if MPA can properly handle hardlinks.
        It prints out "PASS," when succeeds. 


4. Documents

    To build the programming guide documents, assuming you have a recent 
    version of doxygen installed on your build system:
    
    % cd doc
    % doxygen doxy_conf.txt

    Above commands will produce html directory. You can access
    the main page by pointing html/index.html to your favorate 
    web browser.  In addition, man directory contains the same 
    information in the manpage format.  Further, if you want to build 
    a latex-based reference manual
   
    % cd latex
    % make
