[BUILD and INSTALLATION]
    % make
    % make install


[DOCUMENTATION]
    To build the documentation (assuming you have a recent version
    of doxygen installed on your build system).
    
    % cd doc
    % doxygen doxy_conf.txt

    Above commands will produce html directory. You can access
    the main page by pointing html/index.html to your favorate 
    web browser.  In addition, man directory contains the same 
    information in the manpage format.  Further, if you want to build 
    a latex-based reference manual
   
    % cd latex
    % make
