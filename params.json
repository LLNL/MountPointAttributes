{"name":"FGFS Mount Point Attributes","tagline":"Mount Point Attributes Module","body":"### Welcome to FGFS Mount Point Attributes module Pages.\r\nLarge-scale systems typically mount many different file systems with distinct performance characteristics and capacity. High performance computing applications must efficiently use this storage in order to realize their full performance potential. Users must take into account potential file replication throughout the storage hierarchy as well as contention in lower levels of the I/O system, and must consider communicating the results of file I/O between application processes to reduce file system accesses. Addressing these issues and optimizing file accesses requires detailed run-time knowledge of file system performance characteristics and the location(s) of files on them.\r\n\r\nWe developed Fast Global File Status (FGFS) to provide a scalable mechanism to retrieve such information of a file, including its degree of distribution or replication and consistency. FGFS uses a novel node-local technique that turns expensive, non-scalable file system calls into simple string comparison operations. FGFS raises the namespace of a locally-defined file path to a global namespace with little or no file system calls to obtain global file properties efficiently. Our evaluation on a large multi-physics application showed that most FGFS file status queries on its executable and 848 shared library files complete in 272 milliseconds or faster at 32,768 MPI processes. Even the most expensive operation, which checks global file consistency, completes in under 7 seconds at this scale, an improvement of several orders of magnitude over the traditional checksum technique.\r\n\r\nThe main abstractions that enable raising the namespace of local file names are packaged up into the MountPointAttributes module. The core technique of MountPointAttributes is a scalable mechanism to raise the local namespace of a file to a global namespace. The global namespace enables fast comparisons of local file properties across distributed machines with little or no access requirement on the underlying file systems. More specifically, the file name resolution engine of MountPointAttributes turns a local file path into a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a globally unique identifier of the file. This resolution process is merely a memory operation, as our technique builds an URI through the file system mount point table, which is available in system memory. Thus, this core logic requires no communication and can scale well.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
